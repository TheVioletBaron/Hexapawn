QUESTIONS:
1. Compute the total number of board positions for each of the following board sizes: (a) 3 × 4,
(b) 3 × 5, and (c) 4 × 4. Note that as mentioned previously, there are 252 board positions for
the standard 3 × 3 board.

a) 10783 b) 215150 c) 4197973 NOTE - Before answering this question, I tried to play a 5x5 game
and I thought there was an issue with the program. Now it makes sense.

2. For each of the following board sizes, determine who, if anyone, has the advantage (white or
black, assuming that white moves first): (a) 3 × 3, (b) 3 × 4, and (c) 4 × 3. Essentially, this
question is asking whether it’s better to move first or second in a game of Hexapawn using
the specified board size. In addition to answering the question itself, you should explain how
you arrived at your answer (e.g., what your test results were).

a) Going second is an advantage, and it took the computer 13 losses to figure out that it 
couldn't win. (I asked it to play 1000 games, but by game 50 it was conceding on turn one)
b) Going second is still an advantage, but this time the computer lost 115 times before it 
started to concede on turn one. (Again, I asked for 1000 games)
c) Going first is an advantage this time, and took 73 losses to figure out that the game was
unwinnable. (Again, of 1000 games)
